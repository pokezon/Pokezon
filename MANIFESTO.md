### Daily process

* Morning standup started by yesterday's Taskmaster
  * New roles assigned (by yesterday’s Taskmaster)
  * Yesterday? Today? Obstacles? (by today’s Taskmaster)
* Pair program on assigned tasks
* Record issues that are non-blocking and discuss right after lunch at re-group meeting
* Bring up any blocking issues after 15 minutes of spinning your wheels
  * At 2:30pm have re-group meeting where you check-in with blockers, status updates and
    plan for EOD merge. Also, optional merge review if multiple features are completed
* Immediately prior to end of day make applicable PRs, review each other’s code and
  merge into master

#### Team expectations

* Each of us reserves the rights to our nights and weekends, and we have all been
  straightforward about when and how we can commit to working on the project
* If you have a blocking issue, slack before interrupting another’s train of coding-thought
* We will assign tasks vertically (instead of horizontally)
* None of us will specialize in terms of front-end and back-end code
* Don’t interrupt - raise your hand
* Share the mic
* Disagree often and discuss -- argue infrequently
* At least message the group when you change what you are working on
  Issues
* If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:

1.  Take 10-15 minute break
2.  List out the pros / cons
3.  Vote on it
4.  If the vote is split, escalate to a fellow or instructor
    * If you are frustrated
    * Take a walk or get some water
    * Talk constructively about actionable items (e.g. raise your hand instead of
      interrupting, let me learn and struggle until I ask you for help, etc.)
    * Bring in a 3rd party (e.g. fellow, instructor) to mediate if you feel too frustrate

* Friday hard cut off on code at 6 PM EST.
* Saturdays 12 - 6 working on campus
* Sunday optional work on low hanging fruit. Be prepared to discuss changes on Monday.
